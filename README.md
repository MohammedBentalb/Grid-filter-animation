# Simple Grid Animation

### react + framer-motion

I tried to make some animation for the behavior of grid and flex using either pure css or framer-motion. Yet, both were pretty hard since the grid has some weird behaviors so i stuck with some basic ones using just **Layout** and regular animation of opacity.

## Preview :

## Tech :

- `react` : to have a quick setup.
- `react-query` : i used it just for the sake of cashing (`you could use swr for that`).
- `tailwind`: i used regular css for setting the grid and tailwind for styling other things.
